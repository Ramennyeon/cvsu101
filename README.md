#### TODO
```
**1st create github account**
-Drop email/username in gc to be added as collaborator

**2nd Paste given link to "Clone A Repository" in VS**
-Ignore ".vs " in GitChanges (Nasa loob nayan ng VS)
```

#### PRACTICE
```
-Always Fetch & Pull before starting your code(Why? Para updated copy nyo ng system)

-Always cntrl S(save) -> Fetch -> Pull -> Push to upload your code into repository(main)

-In Gitpush, always make text descriptive when pushing. i.e changes in log in page, design change in dashboard etc.

-Work on your respective branches (Why? para controlled)

-When there's merge conflict **DO NOT OVERWRITE** your collaborators code

-Mention Eyara when done in part (Why? so it can be uploaded/confirmed)
```
